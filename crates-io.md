<!-- Xavier readme rendered on crates.io -->

Introducing Xavier: A Simplified XML Parsing Library **Inspired** by Serde. Why Xavier? Well... it starts with X, and it's the first name that came out of my mind, nothing else.

Xavier is a lightweight and versatile XML parsing library designed to streamline the process of handling XML data with ease and efficiency.

While speed is a consideration in Xavier's design, it's important to emphasize that raw speed isn't its primary goal. Instead, Xavier prioritizes ease of use and ergonomic design, aiming to simplify XML parsing tasks within Rust applications without sacrificing reliability or developer experience.
